Hi! I am a geospatial consultant based in [Bogor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogor), Indonesia. I create maps, play with spatial data and satellite imagery, write code, contribute to FLOSS, listening to [Iwan Fals](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwan_Fals), pencak silat, climbing, cycling, and drawing.

My formal education background was actually [Meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology), I got my Bachelor for this major in 2006 from [IPB](https://ipb.ac.id). However my interest has been growing much broader since I was a student. I love GIS, Remote Sensing and computer programming and decided to work on those fields. I’ve been very lucky to get various working opportunities. Got the chances to work with governments, non-government and international organizations in disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation and mitigation and some other interesting fields. From my work I’ve got chances to travel, live in some interesting places, learn interesting cultures, eat lots of delicious (or sometimes weird) foods!. I love what I do and I am eager to keep continuing this path. People says that the more we get involved, the more interesting this is. The more I learn, the more I realized how much I do not know. 

Currently, I work for the United Nations [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia) as a Earth Observation and Climate Analyst under Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping unit and supporting Indonesia Country Office and Bangkok Regional Bureau (RBB) for Asia and Pacific. In 2015, I started working on an [award-winning](https://insight.wfp.org/wfp-staff-show-entrepreneurial-side-in-annual-competition-be03924215) tech innovation project to solve hunger called VAMPIRE (Vulnerability Analysis and Monitoring Platform for Impact of Regional Events).
